LIMITED WARRANTY POLICY Tweed extends the following Limited Warranty to the original retail purchaser of either the LUMA or JUJU Power battery (the \\\"Battery\\\"). When used as directed, your Battery is warranted against defects in manufacture and workmanship that appear within one (1) year of the date of your purchase and that prevent it from functioning as intended. Tweed will replace such defective Battery at no cost to you. Replacements may be with new or refurbished parts, in Tweed\\u2019s sole discretion. For Batteries purchased at a Tweed retail location or online through www.tweed.com, to obtain a replacement battery, you must send your battery to Tweed or return it to a Tweed retail location. Please contact customer care using the contact information found in Section 24 of these Terms to receive your pre-paid return shipping label. Your return must be made within 30 days of the malfunctioning of the Battery and include your original receipt. For Batteries purchased through third party retailers, you must contact them directly to receive your replacement Battery. For clarity, this warranty does not cover Batteries that are damaged due to abuse, neglect, misuse, alteration, unauthorized attempts to repair, use of special additives, excessive heat, fire, puncture, immersion in liquid or theft. This expressed Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have different rights that may vary from province to province according to applicable legislation.

Any applicable implied warranty or condition that cannot be disclaimed or excluded is limited in duration to the period specified above. If any term of this Limited Warranty is deemed to be precluded by applicable Canadian law, such term shall be considered severed from this warranty. The remaining terms continue in effect with the intention of the original drafting preserved as much as possible. EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY: Except as provided in this Limited Warranty, Tweed will not be liable in contract, tort or otherwise for any negligence, or any direct, indirect, economic, commercial, incidental, consequential, or special loss or damage or expense or claim, howsoever caused, arising in connection with the sale, use, loss of use, performance or non-performance of the Battery or part thereof.
